## Why Reaction.js?

The reason behind Reaction.js is to provide a way to use **reactive models**, computed properties and watchers in **non-Vue/React/Angular** environments.

The scope of this library **has nothing to do with UI**. It doesn't provide a way to bind your model to de UI. However, you can achieve some kind of binding using watchers (see [watch()](#watch) method)
and [event listeners](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener).

## Installation

### Using NPM

Install the latest stable version:

```bash
npm install --save @nestorrente/reactionjs
```

Then you can import _Reaction.js_ methods in your modules:

```javascript
import {ref, reactive, computed, watch, nextTick} from '@nestorrente/reactionjs';

// ...or import all within an object
import * as Reaction from '@nestorrente/reactionjs';
```

### Using `<script>` tag

You can [download the latest version from here](dist/reaction.bundle.js). Then, you can use it as any other JavaScript file:

```html
<script src="reaction.bundle.js"></script>
```

Or, if you prefer, you can use any of the following CDN repositories:

```html
<!-- Unpkg -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@nestorrente/reactionjs@0.3.3"></script>

<!-- JsDelivr -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@nestorrente/reactionjs@0.3.3"></script>
```

The script will create a global  `Reaction` object, which contains all the exported methods.

## Usage

### Using `import`

```javascript
import {ref, reactive, computed, watch, nextTick} from '@nestorrente/reactivejs';

const trainersName = ref('Ash');

const pokemon = reactive({
    name: 'Pikachu',
    level: 5
});

const nextLevel = computed(() => pokemon.level + 1);
```

### Using `Reaction` object

You can invoke any method just by doing `Reaction.methodName()`:

```javascript
const trainersName = Reaction.ref('Ash');

const pokemon = Reaction.reactive({
    name: 'Pikachu',
    level: 5
});

const nextLevel = Reaction.computed(() => pokemon.level + 1);
```

You can also use ES6 _destructuring assignment_ in order to imitate module imports:

```javascript
const {ref, reactive, computed, watch, nextTick} = Reaction;

const trainersName = ref('Ash');

const pokemon = reactive({
    name: 'Pikachu',
    level: 5
});

const nextLevel = computed(() => pokemon.level + 1);
```

## Method reference

### ref()

```typescript
function ref<T>(value: T): Ref<T>
```

Creates a reactive object representing a single value:

```javascript
const name = ref('Pikachu');
console.log(name.value); // prints "Pikachu"

name.value = 'Charizard';
console.log(name.value); // prints "Charizad"
```

### reactive()

```typescript
function reactive<T>(object: T): T
```

Creates a reactive object with multiple properties:

```javascript
const pokemon = reactive({
    name: 'Pikachu',
    level: 5,
    stats: {
        attack: 13,
        defense: 8,
        speed: 17,
        special: 11
    },
    moves: [
        'Thunder Shock',
        'Growl'
    ]
});

console.log(pokemon.level); // prints 5
console.log(pokemon.stats.attack); // prints 13

pokemon.level += 1;
console.log(pokemon.level); // prints 6
```

#### References inside reactive objects

It's also possible to use a reference as the value of a property. When getting the value of a reactive object's property, references are automatically unwrapped (as Vue.js does):

```javascript
const name = ref('Pikachu');

const pokemon = reactive({
    name, // <-- the reference
    level: 5
});

// Access using the reference
console.log(name.value); // prints "Pikachu"

// Access through the reactive object (no '.value' is needed)
console.log(pokemon.name); // prints "Pikachu"

// Modifications made to the reference affect the object's property, and vice versa

name.value = 'Charizard';
console.log(pokemon.name); // prints "Charizard"

pokemon.name = 'Mewtwo';
console.log(name.value); // prints "Mewtwo"
```

#### Reactivity limitations

_Reaction.js_ can only observe changes in JavaScript plain objects. This means it can't observe changes made to complex types like [Date](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Referencia/Objetos_globales/Date), [Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Referencia/Objetos_globales/Array), [Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Referencia/Objetos_globales/Map), [Set](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Referencia/Objetos_globales/Set), [WeakMap](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Referencia/Objetos_globales/WeakMap) or [WeakSet](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Referencia/Objetos_globales/WeakSet). However, you can use an immutable approach in order to achieve reactivity. We strongly recommend you to use the great [Immutable.js](https://github.com/immutable-js/immutable-js) library for this purpouse :slightly_smiling_face:

For those who doesn't want to add another library to their projects, here we show you some _vanilla JS_ immutability examples for Date and Array objects:

<ins>Date</ins>

Example data object:

```javascript
const pokemon = reactive({
    name: 'Pikachu',
    dateOfCapture: new Date(2020, 0, 1)
});
```

Don't do this üëé

```javascript
pokemon.dateOfCapture.setMonth(2);
```

Do this instead üëç

```javascript
// Clone the Date object
const newDateOfCapture = new Date(pokemon.dateOfCapture.getTime());

// Modify the new object
newDateOfCapture.setMonth(2);

// Set the new object as the value of the property
pokemon.dateOfCapture = newDateOfCapture;
```

<ins>Array</ins>

Example data object:

```javascript
const pokemon = reactive({
    name: 'Pikachu',
    moves: [
        'Thunder Shock',
        'Growl'
    ]
});
```

Don't do this üëé

```javascript
// Append one element at the end
pokemon.moves.push('Tail Whip');

// Modify one element by index
pokemon.moves[index] = 'Thunder';

// Remove the last element
pokemon.moves.pop();
```

Do this instead üëç

```javascript
// Append one element at the end
pokemon.moves = [...pokemon.moves, 'Tail Whip'];

// Modify one element by index
pokemon.moves = [
    ...pokemon.moves.slice(0, index),
    'Thunder',
    ...pokemon.moves.slice(index+1)
];

// Remove the last element
pokemon.moves = pokemon.moves.slice(0, -1);
```

#### Caveats

Calling `reactive()` returns a new object that is observed. Changes made on this object will be reflected on the original one:

```javascript
const originalObject = {
    name: 'Pikachu',
    // ... other properties...
};

const reactiveObject = reactive(originalObject);

reactiveObject.name = 'Charizard';
console.log(originalObject.name); // prints "Charizard"
```

However, changes made directly on the original object will not tracked by the system &ndash; this implies that computed properties as watchers will not work as expected. The recommendation is to not store the original object and always use the one returned by `reactive()`:

```javascript
// Don't do this üëé
const pokemon = {
    name: 'Pikachu'
};
reactive(pokemon);

// Do this instead üëç
const pokemon = reactive({
    name: 'Pikachu'
});
```

### computed()

```typescript
function computed<T>(callback: () => T): Readonly<Ref<T>>
```

This method creates a read-only reference whose value is the result of invoking the `callback` function. It's value is automatically invalidated and recomputed when any of its dependencies change:



```javascript
const pokemon = reactive({
    name: 'Pikachu'
});

const upperCaseName = computed(() => pokemon.name.toUpperCase());

console.log(upperCaseName.value); // prints "PIKACHU"

pokemon.name = 'Charizard'; // old value is invalidated
console.log(upperCaseName.value); // value is recomputed, and "CHARIZARD" is printed
```

You can also use a reference as a dependency:

```javascript
const name = ref('Pikachu');

const upperCaseName = computed(() => name.value.toUpperCase());

console.log(upperCaseName.value); // prints "PIKACHU"

name.value = 'Charizard';
console.log(upperCaseName.value); // prints "CHARIZARD"
```

If you try to modify a computed property, you will get an error:

```javascript
upperCaseName.value = 'MEWTWO'; // Error: Cannot modify the value of a readonly reference
```

### watch()

```typescript
function watch(callback: SimpleEffect): StopHandle;
function watch<T>(source: Ref<T> | () => T, callback: WatcherCallBack<T>): StopHandle;
```
Related types:

```typescript
type SimpleEffect = (onCleanup: CleanupRegistrator) => void;
type WatcherCallBack<T> = (newVal: T, oldVal: T | undefined, onCleanup: CleanupRegistrator) => void;
type StopHandle = () => void;
type CleanupRegistrator = (invalidate: () => void) => void;
```

This method allows you to define a watcher function that will be executed every time one of it's dependencies changes. You can define its dependencies using the `source` parameter, or let _Reaction.js_ to track them for you.

Watchers are executed asynchronously. This means that you can do several data modifications in a row before any watcher is executed. If you want to wait for watcher's execution before continue, you can use the [`nextTick()`](#nexttick) function.   

We will cover all the `watch()` function features in an incremental way.

#### Simple effect watcher

Let's define some data:

```javascript
const pokemon = reactive({
    name: 'Pikachu',
    level: 5,
    stats: {
        attack: 13,
        defense: 8,
        speed: 17,
        special: 11
    },
});
```

Now, let's define a watcher that allows us to do some operations when the Pokemon's level changes:

```javascript
watch(onCleanup => {

    const {name, level, stats} = pokemon;

    // Show info message
    console.log(`${name} grew to level ${level}`);

    // Update stats
    stats.attack += 3;
    stats.defense += 2;
    stats.speed += 4;
    stats.special += 2;

});
```

As soon as the watcher has been created, its callback is executed for the first time. As you can see, the callback reads all the properties from the `pokemon` object (`name`, `level` and `stats`). As we didn't declare a _source_ for the watcher, **every property accessed** within the callback **is considered a dependency**. This means that the callback will be executed every time that `name`, `level` or any of the `stats` changes. What if we want the callback to execute only on `level` property changes? We must define a _source_.

_Note: you may have noticed the `onCleanup` callback parameter. We will cover it in the [CleanupRegistrator](#cleanupregistrator) section._

#### Watcher with source and callback

`watch()` method allows you to define a **source**, which can be a **reference** or a **callback**, in order to specify the dependencies of the watcher.

Let's rewrite the previous example in order to define the `level` property as the only dependency of the callback:

```javascript
watch(
    // Source callback
    () => pokemon.level,

    // Execution callback
    (oldValue, newValue, onCleanup) => {

        const {name, stats} = pokemon;

        // Show info message
        console.log(`${name} grew to level ${newValue}`);

        // Update stats
        stats.attack += 3;
        stats.defense += 2;
        stats.speed += 4;
        stats.special += 2;

    }
);
```

This way, the watcher will ignore changes made on the other properties, and will execute its callback only on `level` property changes.

_Note: every property accessed within the source callback is considered a dependency, no matter if that property is returned by the callback or not._

As you can see, the execution callback now receives 2 more parameters:

 - `oldValue`: the previous value of the dependency. In the first watcher's execution, its value is `undefined`.
 - `newValue`: the new value of the dependency.
 - `onCleanup`: we will cover it in the [CleanupRegistrator](#cleanupregistrator) section.

Also, when your dependency is a reference, you can use the reference itself as the source of a watcher:

```javascript
const nextLevel = computed(() => pokemon.level + 1);

watch(
    // this is equivalent to: () => nextLevel.value
    nextLevel,
    (newValue, oldValue, onCleanup) => {
        const {name} = pokemon;
        console.log(`${name}'s next level is ${newValue}`);
    }
);
```

Finally, if you want to define multiple dependencies, the source callback may return an array:

```javascript
watch(
    // Source callback
    () => [
        pokemon.stats.attack,
        pokemon.stats.defense
    ],

    // Execution callback
    (oldValues, newValues, onCleanup) => {
        const {name} = pokemon;
        const [oldAttack, oldDefense] = oldValues;
        const [newAttack, newDefense] = newValues;
        console.log(`${name}'s attack changed from ${oldAttack} to ${newAttack}`);
        console.log(`${name}'s defense changed from ${oldDefense} to ${newDefense}`);
    }
)
```

Please, notice that now `oldValues` and `newValues` parameters are arrays containing the old and new values of each of the dependencies respectively.

#### CleanupRegistrator

:construction: _This section is under construction_ :construction:

<!--
But before that, did you notice the `onCleanup` parameter? That parameter is a function that allows you to define a callback for execute some cleanup code just before the watcher gets executed again
-->

#### StopHandle

:construction: _This section is under construction_ :construction:

The `StopHandle` object is a function returned by `watch()` method. You can call it whenever you want to stop a watcher &ndash; that is, prevent its future executions:

```javascript
const stopWatcher = watch(() => {
    const {name} = pokemon;
    console.log(`Pokemon's name changed to: ${name}`);
});

pokemon.name = 'Charizard'; // will trigger watchers execution

stopWatcher(); // watcher will not be executed anymore
```

### nextTick()

```typescript
function nextTick(callback: () => void): void
```

Allows you to execute a portion of code in the next event cycle of the execution environment. This is actually the same as `setTimeout(callback, 0)`.

This method is very useful when you are doing multiple data modifications and you want wait for watcher's execution before continue:

```javascript
const pokemon = reactive({
    name: 'Pikachu',
    level: 5
});

watch(() => {
    const { name, level } = pokemon;
    console.log(`${name} grew to level ${level}`);
});

pokemon.level = 6;
pokemon.level = 7;
pokemon.level = 8;

nextTick(() => {
    pokemon.level = 9;
    pokemon.level = 10;
});

```

Console output will be:

```javascript
"Pikachu grew to level 5" // initial watcher's execution
"Pikachu grew to level 8" // watcher's execution before nextTick() callback
"Pikachu grew to level 10" // watcher's execution after nextTick() callback
```
